Cooklang: 


In CookLang, ingredients are prefixed with @, cookware with #, and timers with ~.

Ingredients:
To define an ingredient, use the @ symbol before the ingredient and {} at the end. If the ingredientâ€™s name contains multiple words, indicate the end of the name with {}.
Example: 
Original:
Cooklang: Then add @salt and @ground black pepper{} to taste.

To indicate the quantity of an item, place the quantity inside {} after the name.
Example: 
Original: Poke holes in 2 potatos.
Cooklang: Poke holes in @potato{2}.

To use a unit of an item, such as weight or volume, add a % between the quantity and unit.
Example: 
Original: Place 1kg of bacon strips on a baking sheet and glaze with 1/2 tbsp of syrup.
Cooklang: Place @bacon strips{1%kg} on a #baking sheet{} and glaze with @syrup{1/2%tbsp}.

Cookware:
You can define any necessary cookware with # and end cookware with {}.
Examples:
Original: Place the potatoes into a pot.
Cooklang: Place the @potato{} into a #pot{}.
Original: Mash the potatoes with a potato masher.
Cooklang: Mash the @potatoes{} with a #potato masher{}.

Timer:
You can define a timer using ~.
Example:
Original: Lay the potatoes on a baking sheet and place into the oven. Bake for 25 minutes.
Cooklang: Lay the @potatoes{} on a #baking sheet{} and place into the #oven{}. Bake for ~{25%minutes}.

Timers can have a name too, for example:
Original: Boil 2 eggs for 3 minutes.
Cooklang: Boil @eggs{2} for ~eggs{3%minutes}.
